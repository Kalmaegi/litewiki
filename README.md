# litewiki

A lightweight CLI documentation generator inspired by [DeepWiki](deepwiki.com).

I really like DeepWiki because I enjoy reading different code; this project is just my clumsy imitation of DeepWiki.

## TODO

I intend to implement this project step by step. 
1. **Generate a simple overview** of the entire codebase structure. 
2. **Produce a call graph** to visualize function and module relationships. 
3. **Render detailed documentation** for each component and API, breaking down implementation details.
